QBATCH(1)               User   Contributed   Perl   Documentation

NAME
       qbatch - submits a command line to Grid Engine or PBS  via
qsub

SYNOPSIS
       qbatch [options] [--queue] -- command

       qbatch  is designed to be inserted before any command that
       you would usually run from the command line.  In case of 
       argument collision where both your command and qbatch 
       share an option such as --verbose be sure to use the '--'
       syntax to split qbatch  options  from  the commands
       options

          $ qbatch --verbose -- mincmath --verbose ...

DESCRIPTION
       qbatch  is  a quick hack if you don't want to write a qsub
       script

       The idea is to just bung qbatch in front  of  any  command
       you would normally enter on the command line. (as per 'nice')

        eg:
           $ qbatch ls -F
           $  qbatch  -q  wb325.q@taylor -N job23 -- mincmath \
                fred.mnc ..
